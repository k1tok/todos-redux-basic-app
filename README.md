## Introduction

The Todos Users Redux Basic App is a simple yet comprehensive project designed to help developers grasp the core concepts of Redux in a React environment. This project showcases how to manage application state using Redux, handle asynchronous actions with Redux Thunk, and efficiently use hooks like useDispatch and useSelector. It also demonstrates the integration of Redux DevTools for state inspection and debugging.

## Features

- State Management with Redux: Centralized state management to keep the app state predictable and maintainable.
- Hooks Integration: Usage of useDispatch and useSelector hooks to seamlessly interact with the Redux store in functional components.
- Combining Reducers: Modular approach to state management by combining multiple reducers using combineReducers.
- Asynchronous Actions: Handling asynchronous operations using Redux Thunk to fetch and manipulate data.
- Array Handling in Reducers: Demonstrations of common array operations within reducers, showcasing best practices.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todos-users-redux-basic-app.git
cd todos-users-redux-basic-app
npm install
```

## Usage

After completing the installation, you can start the project locally using:

```bash
npm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.
```

## Concepts Covered

- Reducers: Functions responsible for handling state transitions based on dispatched actions.
- Actions: Plain objects that describe changes in the state, sometimes including data to modify the state.
- useDispatch/useSelector: React hooks for dispatching actions and selecting parts of the state from the Redux store.
- CombineReducers: A utility to merge multiple reducer functions into a single root reducer, simplifying state management.

- Array Handling: Practical examples of manipulating arrays within Redux state to ensure immutable state updates.
- Redux Thunk: Middleware for handling side effects and asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API.
